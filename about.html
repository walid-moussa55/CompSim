            <h2>About Computer Architecture</h2>
            <p>Computer architecture refers to the design and structure of a computer's key components and how they interact to perform various tasks. Let’s take a closer look at the primary parts: the CPU, RAM, and output devices.</p>
            
            <h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
            <p>The CPU, often called the brain of the computer, is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It consists of two main components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control Unit (CU):</strong> The Control Unit manages and coordinates all activities within the computer. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and directs other parts of the computer to carry out these instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> The ALU handles all arithmetic calculations (such as addition and subtraction) and logical operations (such as comparisons). It performs the actual data processing tasks directed by the CU.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>
            <p>RAM is the computer's temporary working memory, where data and instructions are stored while the CPU processes them. It allows the CPU to quickly access data needed for running applications, making it an essential component for efficient computing. Unlike storage devices, RAM is volatile, meaning it loses all data when the computer is turned off.</p>
            
            <h3>Output</h3>
            <p>Output devices display or convey the results of the computer’s processing to the user. Common output devices include monitors (which display visual output) and printers (which produce physical copies of data). The output helps users understand the results of their interactions with the computer.</p>
            
            <p>By working together, the CPU, RAM, and output devices enable a computer to perform tasks efficiently, process data, and present the results in a way that users can understand and interact with.</p>
